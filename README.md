_The language package for Projectfork 4_

* **Please note:** This Language Pack is for Projectfork 4.x only!*

## Quick start
This file contains all the languages which are currently available for Projectfork 4.x for Joomla! 2.5 and 3.2.

We recommend that you install the most recent language every time you have upgraded Projectfork (If you installed the "Language Pack", you could use the update function from Joomla!).


### Projectfork Language Pack - **[download the latest release](https://github.com/projectfork/Translations/tree/master/archive/zips)**


#### Installing languages in Joomla! 2.5+ and 3.2+
Just install this package by using Joomla installer. If you cannot install the package because of 2MB upload limit, you can either install the package from URL or make the file smaller by removing a few languages you do not need.

Installer will detect which languages have been installed into your system. It will install or update only existing languages, so if you add new languages after installing this package, you will need to install the "Language Pack" again.

Every language will be installed separately to allow you to uninstall them one by one if needed. You can find installed languages by going to "Extension Manager: Manage" and filtering results by "Projectfork Language".

Additionally the "Extension Manager" will have a package called "Projectfork Language Pack Installer". Uninstalling this package will also uninstall all the languages that were added during installation. The source language *en-GB* will still exists.
